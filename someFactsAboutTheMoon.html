              <p><i>The near and far sides of the Moon</i></p>

              <p>For almost the last twenty years the Moon has felt, at least
                mentally, like a second home while I've worked through the book series.</p>
                
                <p>Let's share some facts about our nearest neighbour. Some you
                might know, other less so.</p>
                
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <ul>

                  <li>Gravity there is one sixth that of the Earth</li>
                
                  <li>The Moon has almost no atmosphere. While it has more than
                  the vacuum of open space, it's pretty negligible compared to the Earth, with
                  only about 40 molecules per cubic cm of atmosphere. So, if you ever visit, don't
                  forget your spacesuit. Without any significant atmosphere, the Moon also
                  suffers from extremes of temperature, baking in the day at +130C, and plunging
                  at night to -180C.</li>
                  
                  <li>As with the atmosphere, the Moon has almost no magnetic
                  field when compared to the Earth as it's missing the molten core which blesses
                  our home (this magnetic field together with our atmosphere prevents a lot of nasty
                  radiation getting to us).</li>
                  
                  <li>A Lunar day takes 28 Earth days. But it also takes 28 days
                  to orbit the Earth. This means the same side (we call it the light side) is
                  always facing us.</li>
                  
                  <li>Although the far side is often called the dark side, it does
                  actually get light from the Sun</li>
                  
                  <li>The craters on the Moon were once thought to have been
                  caused by volcanoes, however we now know them to be caused by impacts from
                  meteors and other space debris. On Earth, our atmosphere protects us, causing
                  any objects colliding with Earth to burn up before hitting the ground. But
                  without such an atmosphere, the Moon is constantly pummelled by even the
                  smallest objects. This is why the soil on the Moon was observed by Neil
                  Armstrong to be like a really fine powder</li>
                  
                  <li>The near side of the Moon is marked by dramatic features we
                  call <b>mare</b> or 'seas' which were formed by long ago volcanic activity. The
                  geography here is much newer, and consequentially we see less cratering.</li>
                  
                  <li>Maria (multiple of mare) are almost completely absent on the far side of the
                  Moon, and we don't really know why.</li>

                  <li>The maria are darker because they are richer in iron and magenisum. The older highlands are lighter because they're richer in calcium and aluminium.</li>
                  
                  <li>The Moon is much less dense when compared to the Earth. It
                  seems to be made up mainly of rock, with much less metal content, especially lacking
                  a molten metal core like the Earth. This evidence points to an interesting theory
                  about the origin of the Moon; it is made from part of the Earth's surface,
                  which was blasted away in a collision billions of years ago, taking mainly
                  surface material with it to form a new planetary body.</li>
                  
                  <li>Even during Apollo, the Moon was believed to have virtually
                  no water. However, since survey probes in the 90s, there's been significant evidence
                  that there is some water trapped in permanently shadowed craters in the poles.
                  It's also believed there maybe be some water beneath the surface at the poles. This
                  is one of the reasons why building a colony, particularly at the south pole, is
                  seen as quite advantageous</li>
                  
                  <li>Quakes happen on the Moon! First observed, thanks to equipment
                  left behind during Apollo, these quakes have a very different mechanism that on
                  Earth driven by tidal forces from the Earth over tectonic plates. But
                  Moonquakes are much less severe than their Earth counterparts, but can go on
                  much longer, for hours at a time!</li>
                  
                  <li>The Moon is receding away from the Earth by about 4cm every
                  year.</li>
                  
                  <li>It is the only other planetary body which humans have
                  visited (during, obviously the Apollo era, I look forward to updating this for Artemis). During Apollo, we brought back 380kg of rock from the Moon, which is
                  still being studied today. In one of my favourites, they grew plants in lunar
                  soil to prove it was possible! <i>[See below]</i></li>
