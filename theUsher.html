              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              
              <p>Brody wasn’t sure what had happened. One
                moment he’d been walking along the street, heading back to his car after a particularly
                disappointing burger, the next there’d been a shout of alarm quickly followed
                by a deafening crash that had echoed down the brownstone dominated street,</p>
                
                <p>Somehow, in the chaos, he’d found himself face
                down on the sidewalk. What an evening it was turning out to be!</p>
                
                <p>Prying his face away from the pavement, he
                could see that a small crowd of gawping onlookers had gathered around whatever
                had fallen.</p>
                
                <p>The new spectators who joined them seemed
                oblivious to him, and he wasn’t sure if he was going to be trampled on until a smartly
                dressed African American lady came to his rescue.</p>
                
                <p>Hand outstretched, she warmly commentated
                that he looked in need of assistance, which he cautiously accepted, lifting
                himself up before self-consciously dusting himself down.</p>
                
                <p>“Crazy night, huh?” he said as he took a
                better look at her in the street lighting.</p>
                
                <p>She was middle-aged, with short hair in a
                pixie cut which looked like it was fixed dramatically with a healthy
                application of product. She was formally dressed in her stylish high heels, and
                what looked like a stiffly starched orange dress with white-and-gold piping, and
                accessorised brooch. Brody imagined that she was probably on her way back from
                church, and this was her good deed for the day.</p>
                
                <p>Out of habit, he did a few stretches to
                check himself out. He’d taken a few tumbles when doing karate training when he
                was younger, and they always seemed like a good idea. He made a mental note
                that with a fall like this onto hard pavement, he would no doubt feel a little
                bruised tomorrow. That seemed to be life in his mid-fifties. His body always
                had to pay a toll.</p>
                
                <p>“Do you really need the street yoga, or you
                <span class=GramE>planning on taking a run next?” she cackled.</p>
                
                <p>Brody was about to rebuke her when he
                noticed, “No. Come to think of it, I actually feel fine.”</p>
                
                <p>Now he took the time to reflect, he didn’t
                even have the ever-present dull ache in his left shoulder from the time a throw
                had dislocated it. It was an injury which had never quite gone away. Until
                right now.</p>
                
                <p>He smiled a little to himself. It was no
                doubt adrenaline masking everything.</p>
                
                <p>“Did you see what happened?” he asked.</p>
                
                <p>She seemed to be stalling, taking a small
                tin out of her pocket, extracting a breath mint from it, and asking him if he
                wanted one. He politely refused.</p>
                
                <p>“Someone was taking a piano out of the
                window. It slipped,” she finally answered.</p>
                
                <p>“Really?” Brody took a step back and looked
                at the top of the brownstone tenement. It was an older building with a hoist on
                the outside to take furniture in and out of apartments, and right now he could see
                the scraps of a rope tangled around it. “I didn’t think anyone used those
                things anymore. Is a fucking coyote moving house and trying to catch a
                roadrunner, or what?”</p>
                
                <p>The lady laughed, and loudly crunched her
                confectionary between her teeth, “A sense of humour, I like that.”</p>
                
                <p>“Good job it missed me.”</p>
                
                <p>She sucked in her teeth a little, giving a
                bit of a grimace, “Oh, it didn’t miss, honey.”</p>
                
                <p>Brody felt his brow furrow in confusion.</p>
                
                <p>She smiled at him again as she continued to
                chomp on her mint, “You need to check behind you, hon.”</p>
                
                <p>He felt the hairs stand up on the back of
                his neck, as a sense of dread began to consume him. What was he going to see?
                He was sure that he didn’t want to know.</p>
                
                <p>But he had to look. She was waiting
                expectantly for him to, urging him on. Taking a steadying breath, he finally turned
                around to follow her direction.</p>
                
                <p>In gaps between the crowd, he could see it
                now, a smashed upright piano, and sticking out from under was a pair of legs.
                Legs that were dressed in chinos and loafers that he recognised. Because they belonged
                to him.</p>
                
                <p>“Is that supposed to be me?”</p>
                
                <p>The lady nodded.</p>
                
                <p>“It was you,” she said with a heavy
                emphasis on the word ‘was’.</p>
                
                <p>“This can’t be,” Brody blurted. His mind grasped
                for an explanation, any explanation rather than what he was looking at. This had
                to be some kind of hallucination.</p>
                
                <p>Remembering his basic first aid, he felt
                for the pulse in his own neck, finding nothing. In desperation, he ended up
                looking at his fitness watch, and sure enough, where a heartbeat should be
                registering there was simply a blank dash.</p>
                
                <p>He told himself that he just needed to snap
                out of it. Rushing over to the crowd, he tried to reach out to them,
                inexplicably being unable to grasp them or get their attention. He might as
                well be trying to touch his own reflection. They continued, oblivious to him.
                Only the lady dressed for church was paying him any attention.</p>
                
                <p>“I’m afraid it is. You’re dead, honey, and I
                know it probably comes as a shock as it does for most. Believe me, few welcome
                it.”</p>
                
                <p>“So, you’re…” Brody’s mind was struggling
                to comprehend what was going on. But if he was dead, and she was talking to
                him, that could only mean one thing. “You’re the grim reaper?”</p>
                
                <p>The smile on her face broadened. She was
                clearly amused.</p>
                
                <p>“Honey, I’m neither grim nor in the reaping
                business. But, yes, I’m the usher to what’s next. You can call me Auntie if you
                like.”</p>
                
                <p>“Are you here to judge me?”</p>
                
                <p>“That’s not my role. I just help you over.”</p>
                
                <p>“But this must be a joke. No one gets
                killed by a fucking piano outside of cartoons. You <span class=GramE>have to
                let me go back!”</p>
                
                <p>“Oh, here we go. And before you ask, we’re
                not <span class=SpellE>gonna end up playing chess for your soul. So,
                tell me, what do you have to go back for?”</p>
                
                <p>“I’m a very important person. The CEO of a healthcare
                company.”</p>
                
                <p>“Yeah, I’m aware. And I really didn’t want
                to mention this, but I’ve crossed over a lot of your customers. Ones with
                completely treatable conditions, only you didn’t let them get it.”</p>
                
                <p>“I didn’t personally reject their care,” Brody
                tried to defend himself. “That wasn’t anything personal. That was business.”</p>
                
                <p>“I thought the job of a healthcare company
                was… I don’t know… providing healthcare? But not your company, it seems. Is
                this really your unfinished business? Did you have more people you needed to deny
                care to as part of your important life’s work?” Auntie said in a patronising
                tone.</p>
                
                <p>Brody took a <span class=GramE>moment,
                sure it sounded bad when you put it simply like that. But she just didn’t get
                it. He tried to think of a compelling argument to make this woman see reason.
                He’d be able to talk her round. He always found a way to charm people.</p>
                
                <p>“You know, my company provides a lot of
                jobs to people. We need to make money to keep those jobs,” he argued. “What
                about them? They depend on me.”</p>
                
                <p>“Do you know what it’s like to be an usher
                to the afterlife? I’m sure you’d be interested in a small slice of my day,” Auntie
                explained, and helped herself to another mint, which she made a show of exuberantly
                crunching on. “My morning involved a young bride on the way to her wedding. She
                was on her way to the happiest day of her life, only to be caught up in a freeway
                pileup.</p>
                
                <p>“Meanwhile, my afternoon involved holding
                the hand of a four-year-old girl whose family home had just been levelled in a declared
                act of self-defence by a neighbouring country. But do you know what? For you, I
                could make an exception.”</p>
                
                <p>Brody grinned at what she was saying, not
                being able to believe his luck. He was going to be able to wiggle his way out
                of this.</p>
                
                <p>“Really?” he replied incredulously.</p>
                
                <p>Auntie fixed him with a stare and her smile
                dropped, “No. Do you really think you’re more deserving than those other tales?
                Or do you just think you’re so special?”</p>
                
                <p>“I can change,” he pleaded.</p>
                
                <p>“It’s too late,” she said coldly, returning
                the tin of mints to her pocket. “I really don’t know why this is such a shock. You’ve
                dealt in life and death more than many mortals have. When you condemned people
                to their fate, you just expected them to accept it with good grace.”</p>
                
                <p>“But this is different.”</p>
                
                <p>She asked him why, and he stopped for a
                moment to ponder that, not liking the response.</p>
                
                <p>“Because this affects me,” he answered
                honestly, hearing his own words and having an uncomfortable moment of revelation.
                But she was right, it was too late to do any good. Much too late.</p>
                
                <p>“<span class=SpellE>Mmm-hmm?” she sighed
                in disappointment, giving the air of a teacher who’d just been given a stock
                answer to why their student’s homework was missing. “Look, we can’t put this
                off forever. We need to go. There are people waiting for you.”</p>
                
                <p>“My friends and family?” Brody asked,
                closing his eyes and imagining who would really be waiting for him.</p>
                
                <p>Auntie smiled at him again, but there was
                no warmth in it now.</p>
                
                <p>“You’d better hope so.”</p>
