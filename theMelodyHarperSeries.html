              <p><i><center>Melody Harper, the central character of the series. The artwork for the cover and characters was done by the talented Emilia Harasim.</center></i></p>

              <p>Like many authors, my ideas behind the book series that
              would consume my life came significantly before my ability and focus to write
              it.</p>
              
              <p>It began in 2003, when I was having a tough time of things,
              suffering from depression, and dealing with significant toxicity at work.</p>
              
              <p>Staying at a friend's house for a weekend, I noticed a book
              on their shelf belonging to Arthur C Clarke. I associated books like this as a
              form of comfort food of my teen years and as I reread this one it reignited my
              passion.</p>
              
              <p>At the time, we were talking about how we were ten years
              away from returning to the Moon (this time as the Constellation program, which
              would be cancelled a few years later). This has been a theme throughout my life
              - since the late seventies everyone has talked about how a return to the Moon
              is only ten years away. And yet, it never actually got any closer (I know as I
              write this, we might actually be closer thanks to Artemis, but still, it remains
              to be seen).</p>
              
              <p>Over the weeks that followed, I had this vision of a somewhat
              difficult teenager with an attitude moving from the Earth to the Moon, and
              finding the change of scene difficult. That was my hook to get me started!</p>
              
              <img src="./img/biodome.png" width="480" height="270" class="center">
              <p><i><center>The domes of the Valley Forge in Silent Running were a huge inspiration.</center></i></p>

              <p>With a passionate hunger, I tried to work out what a colony
              on the Moon would be like, and how it would function, reading everything I
              could about planned colonies, where ice was likely to be found, how scientists
              had grown plants in samples of Lunar soil brought back from Apollo. I was
              obsessed with my colonists trying to grow their own food and air there in
              something like the giant domes from Silent Running.</p>
              
              <p>Life on the Moon would be all about recycling water and
              technology as well as growing what you eat (meaning mainly vegan). There's no
              doubt about it, for an Earth girl, it would be a shock to the system.</p>
              
              <p>This was my starting point, but it took several goes to get
              it right. I realised I wanted to talk about 'adult' themes ' about feeling
              alone, dealing with sexual harassment, discovering your sexuality, dealing with
              mental health and loss. </p>
              
              <p>I say 'adult' because a lot of these are seen as 18+ issues,
              but the horrid truth is that these topics are very prevalent in the overwhelming
              life of teenagers (I'd certainly experienced it), and waiting until 18 to talk
              about them, is leaving it too late.</p>
              
              <p>Along the way, Melody won me over and became less of a brat,
              and more someone with passion who was trying to do their best in difficult
              situations and someone I wanted to champion more.</p>
              
              <p>I'd have a go at writing this almost annually, but not be
              pleased with the result. It was finally in 2008 that it would start to take shape,
              and I was encouraged to keep at it by my best friend, Violet. A big thing she encouraged
              me about was Melody being gay. It felt to me originally like it didn't belong
              in a science fiction story, and I kept wondering about removing it, but Violet reassured
              me that it belonged, and it mattered.</p>

              <img src="./img/violet.jpg" width="400" height="267" class="center">
              <p><i><center>My friend Violet, for whom the first book is dedicated to.</center></i></p>
              
              <p>Violet sadly passed away in 2010, but there's not a day of
              writing that I don't remember her passion and a wish to share this story with
              her. I often think about her encouragement to 'make it gay'. Because when I did,
              I found what I was writing moved over from something I thought was intriguing
              to something I had such a passion for.</p>
              
              <p>And here I am, close to finishing book four!</p>
              
              <p>Intrigued? I'd hoped so! You can find the books on Amazon.
              Once the series is complete, I'm looking to publish a compendium on other
              platforms.</p>
