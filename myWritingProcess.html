              <p><i><center>Let's look at the process I follow for writing books</center></i></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>

              <h1>Introduction</h1>
            
              <p>It can feel sometimes like there is supposed to be a 'golden
              path' for writing a book that every author should adhere to, and if you're not following this
              exact set of steps, you're setting yourself up to fail.</p>
              
              <p>But in reality, writing is a very personal endeavour, and every
              writer has her own process and tools that help them, which another writer would
              find confusing or stifling or restrictive.</p>
              
              <p>A lot of discovering what works for you is a process of
              trial and error. That said, though, we're always fascinated in finding out what
              others do, to look at our own process and see if there are other items which we'd
              like to experiment with ourselves.</p>
              
              <p>So, for your entertainment and consideration, here's an
              overview of my writing process, together with the tools I've found help me. 
              You'll find it has a lot of things in common with other writers, but 
              there are some areas where I've put my own spin on. 
              My writing process has been pretty stable over my last few books, but it took me a lot
              of experimentation to get here!</p>
              
              <p>As a bit of background, I've completed a few technical
              publications prior to the Melody Harper series. And now I've been able to add
              in four fictional books.</p>
              
              <p>Many people think writing a novel is easy, but let me tell
              you that fiction, especially science fiction, requires keeping track of a lot
              of items, I find writing novels about three times harder than writing about a
              topic in IT that I've been working on and have experience of. But I love it!</p>
              
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              
              <h1>Planning out</h1>
              
              <p>I like to plan out stories to 'just enough' level upfront. I
              consider this mapping out the key drama, and the items which will lead into
              them.</p>
              
              <p>I really like creating a Word document which has a number of
              tiles representing my key scene. These might be items such as 'friend's
              wedding', 'finding a body in the garden', 'confronting the Governor'.
              Sometimes, but not always, I'll match these to particular characters and play
              around a little to see the basic frame of my novel.</p>
              
              <p>I'll also go into a note taking frenzy fleshing out my world
              bible at this point with anything I think I'll need to know. I use Google Docs,
              and have little breakdowns on character bios, factions, world events to help me
              keep track.</p>
              
              <p>For instance, in book four, I needed to remember the
              Governor's last name and the designation of the crashed Selene lander ' well,
              my world bible helps me keep track of this!</p>
              
              <p>The world bible reminds me of the notes you'd get in the
              back of books like The Wheel Of Time, Dune, The Sage Of The Exiles to help you
              keep track of who's who. Only now it's helping me keep track of a myriad of
              small details as the actual author.</p>
              
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              
              <h1>The First Draft</h1>
              
              <p>I have a mentality about writing the first draft that 'it's
              okay to be messy'. I really do find that 'perfection is the enemy of done',
              especially for writers. What's the point of getting a paragraph really polished
              if come editing you realise you don't need it?</p>
              
              <p>Putting together a 300-page novel is hard enough. For folks
              like me for whom this is not a full-time job, you are stitching together an
              hour here and there of work, and it becomes like slowly assembling a jigsaw puzzle.</p>
              
              <p>I find if I overly focus on quality at this stage, I get
              bogged down in the weeds and even stall in my writing. I need to keep moving
              forward.</p>
              
              <p>I have friends such as Johanna Rothman and Lily Seagrove who
              are passionate about 'writing clean', and that works for them. You find this a
              lot in the writing community. The only method that matters is the one which
              works for you!</p>
              
              <p>I typically write for about an hour a day for roughly five days
              out of the week. I find it important not to overdo it or do every day. This is
              because life can happen and if I miss a day's writing, I get anxious about it, feeling
              that I've fallen behind. I have found that it's important to find what we in
              the agile community (it's a method of working within IT) call a sustainable pace.</p>
              
              <p>Sustainable pace is all about finding a way to work that isn't
              exhausting you and hence allows you consistency. I have a great job, and for
              me, writing is my hobby and escape. So, it's important that I find it fun and refreshing.
              Writing a book is also a long process ' for me, it takes about six months
              (minimum) to write 100,000 words for a first draft.</p>
              
              <p>I respect that it's a lot of time and overdoing it on any
              one day or a series of days isn't going to make this dramatically shorter.</p>
              
              <p>I write my first draft in Google Docs. This is because I can
              access it anywhere; I can write on the train, during my lunch hour, on the
              couch.</p>
              
              <p>While writing, I try and keep things flowing and avoid
              interrupting myself too much. I sometimes will look up something in my world
              bible, although sometimes the information I wasn't isn't always there. Rather
              than stop and look it up, I'll just add a note mid-sentence to the effect of, '???
              LOOK UP GOVERNORS LAST NAME'.</p>
              
              <p>I also find in dialogue-heavy pages, my first draft will
              often look closer to a film script, as I focus down on capturing the lines said
              between characters and will come back to flower up the language and make it
              look more like a novel later.</p>
              
              <p>Something else I try to do is avoid having other writing projects
              on the go. Like I said, I used to do a lot of technical writing and early on,
              tried to continue this for some nights while doing novel writing during the
              rest of the week. This was a huge mistake, as is just really killed my momentum
              for both projects. This is another principle of agile. When you try to do two
              things relatively concurrently, you invariably don't do either particularly well,
              aka multi-tasking is the devil.</p>
              
              <p>Occasionally another writing project comes up when I'm asked
              to write a technical piece on agile, for instance. Then I find it better to
              find a week where I need a break from my novel, and down tools completely that
              week on it, to focus on that piece of writing. But then I don't pick up novel
              work again until my article is done and out of the door.</p>
              
              <p>One last item I'll mention. While working through my first
              draft, I copy and paste regularly into a Word document backed up on OneDrive,
              so should anything happen, I have a backup. I have a friend who had a nervous
              breakdown after losing their postgrad research, so please, back up your work.</p>
              
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              
              <h1>Dealing with writer's block</h1>
              
              <p>I haven't really had writer's block in the past, although I've
              had plenty of stalled projects.</p>
              
              <p>I have a couple of strategies which help me avoid this,</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li>It's okay to have a night off</li>
              
                <li>My writing doesn't have to be good, it just needs to push
                the story forward. I can go back to polish it later.</li>
              
                <li>If I feel stuck on a chapter, I'll just end it with a comment
                to future me '??? This needs more, but not sure what ???'. Those triple
                question marks are really a sign to myself to fill in the details later.</li>
                
                <li>Sometimes I'll just take a break from a chapter and flesh
                out a future piece because I'm more in the mood to do that</li>

              </ul>

              
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              
              <p><i>So really, I'm the best, most understandable boss to myself.</i></p>
              
              <p>When I'm really stuck, I'll break into one of Brian Eno's oblique
              strategies. They're worth learning more about because they can be excellent to
              make you try something different when you're stuck creatively.</p>

              <h1>>Editing (and then more editing)</h1>
              
              <p>Editing sees a big change of pace. I move my work into Microsoft
              Word in a template I've used for all my books, and check factors like style
              consistency in my text (occasionally there's an Arial or Times New Roman in
              there, for reasons unknown).</p>
              
              <p>Editing fascinates me, and I've sometimes used track changes
              to see how much I've altered.</p>
              
              <p>Commonly I find it's like this. My first draft will block
              out well what's happening, but in editing I will frequently change whole
              paragraphs just so they explain the same activity but in a form that reads more
              eloquently.</p>
              
              <p>I use a paid version of the editing tool ProWritingAid to
              help me polish up my words; it has great styling suggestions and really helps
              me improve the quality of my writing. I don't accept every suggestion and will
              go with my inner coach in any conflict.</p>
              
              <p>Sometimes I'm not sure how well something reads, so I'll often
              use a text to speech program to convert paragraphs so that I can hear them. This
              can be invaluable ' we have an awful trait of writing a sentence and reading it
              a particular way which is vastly different to how people will actually read it.
              The combination of editing tools like ProWritingAid and using text to speech
              programs can help me explore these blind spots in my writing, and polish up my end
              product. [I have an article on why that's helpful on this site]</p>

              <img src="img/prowritingsuggestions.png" class="center">
              <p><i><center>A look at the suggestions I get from ProWritingAid</center></i></p>
              
              
              <p>I also tidy up some of those comments I added in my first
              draft, those '???' items where I needed to find information. Editing is the
              right time to scurry for those details.</p>
              
              <p>Generally, editing is much faster than the first draft, but
              will still take a couple of months. I find a lot of times that because I'm
              editing faster than I wrote the initial draft, I'll pick up some
              inconsistencies a little easier. For example, in one of my favourite 'oops' in
              book 2, I wrote a lovely piece on Melody saying her parents got married when
              she was ten, and she was a bridesmaid at the wedding. Then stumbled over a quote
              from her Mum saying, 'We've been married for 20 years.' [I changed it to her
              grandparents only getting married when she was ten]</p>
              
              <img src="img/editing1.jpg" class="center">
              <img src="img/editing2.jpg" class="center">

              <p><i><center>A look at how much change occurs in a typical first edit cycle.</center></i></p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              
              <p>Once this first editing run through is complete, I take a
              couple of weeks off, then go through it again. This time tends to be much quicker
              (there should be fewer changes require, but you'll still find areas where the
              language needs tightening up).</p>
              
              <p>Depending on how many changes I make, I might do a third
              run, or just target problematic chapters for future editing. Usually, these
              areas are the ones where a lot is happening, or those that required a lot of
              changes in previous edits.</p>
              
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              
              <h1>Beta readers</h1>
              
              <p>For my first book particularly, I used beta readers, and
              incorporated as much of their feedback as I could. With later books, I've had a
              smaller pool of them, because in a book series you need folks who are up to
              date, and can spare the time, so the pool gets a little smaller.</p>
              
              <p>A friend of mine has suggested some spaces I can try out
              once I've polished my book series to the best of my ability. There are lots of ways
              to collaborate with other writers, exchanging a beta read for a beta read.</p>
              
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              
              <h1>Just a reminder, you're not your book</h1>
              
              <p>This is a difficult topic, but now would be a good
              point to bring it up. Feedback can be a difficult thing to go through. My
              friend JD Cadmon summed it up when she said, 'writers really just want to be
              told their book is pretty'. Constructive feedback is hard to give well, and it's
              sometimes emotional to receive.</p>
              
              <p>Like I said, we need to remember we aren't our book. And
              often that feedback leads to a better book. I try to embrace feedback as a
              challenge to up my game and am really thankful for it. But I'll admit sometimes
              I just want it to be done and people to love it.</p>
              
              <p>Similarly, there's the awkward area when you ask friends or
              family to read your book and they don't. It can feel like a rejection. One of
              my closest friends started reading it and admitted it wasn't for them. Of
              course I'm a little sad about that, but I'm also okay with it too.</p>
              
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              
              <h1>Publishing</h1>
              
              <p>Once I'm satisfied, I'll publish on Amazon KDP.</p>
              
              <p>For book one, I spent 18 months trying to go through
              conventional publishing, and I just felt that I was going nowhere (but I also
              wanted to keep writing the series). So self-publishing through Amazon works for
              me ' I love writing, but it doesn't have to pay the bills (that's why I work as
              a drone in IT).</p>
              
              <p>I know many people say about writing 'write the book you
              want to read', but I think with my mix of science fiction, LGBTQIA and human
              relationship themes, these items mixed together don't have a huge market. I've
              had feedback that non-LGBTQIA folks feel that as the lead character is a lesbian,
              it's a book only for LGBTQIA people. I couldn't disagree more, but I hope it's
              just a little ahead of its time, and that attitude will change.</p>
              
              <p>I know though that like many writers, I'm a lousy marketer.
              When book four is finished, I'll not only look at hosting the books on other
              platforms to Amazon but also trying to increase my marketing midichlorians.</p>
